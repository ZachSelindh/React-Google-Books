# React-Google-Books

This application is built on the MERN stack and uses the Google Books API to fetch data relevant to the user's search for a book title.

Users have the ability to favorite a book, which will save it to a MongoDB collection through Mongoose, and to follow relevant links to Google's page for the complete book information.

After favoriting books, users can navigate via React-Router to the "Favorites" page, and there, selectively remove books.

This application is deployed to Heroku.

My first MERN-stack application!
